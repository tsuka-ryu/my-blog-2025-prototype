1 year ago, I was having fun with Next.js App Router.
While experimenting with it on my toy [No Deploy](https://nodeploy-neon.vercel.app), I planned to build documentation.
However, Nextra does not support App Router.

To handle this, I implemented a small documentation site with solely Contentlayer and the new features from App Router.
It was working great, looked blazing-fast and minimal.
I cloned the logic from No Deploy and built this documentation framework.
With a few months of development, it soon became powerful and stable.

It was originally named `next-docs`, I renamed it to Fumadocs as it conflicts with Next.js Docs.

Thanks to the support from **Next.js** community, I've received a lot of suggestions along the way.
[Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) is now a framework used by my libraries and some other amazing projects.
